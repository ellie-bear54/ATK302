    <p> This is Phoebe. She first lived in Nazi-occupied France, where she ran into Captain America. Upon the decimation of her village by the Nazis, she traveled around with Steve and Peggy.
      <br>
      She and Steve then get cryogenically frozen, and when Tony thaws them out, they join the Avengers, and Phoebe models her suit after Natasha Romanoff's. </p>
